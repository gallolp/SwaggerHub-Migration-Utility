# SwaggerHub-Installation-Migration-Utility

SwaggerHub-Installation-Migration-Utility is a migration utility for current SwaggerHub users to move their API Specs and domains to another SwaggerHub Organization. 

The other organization can be in a different installation of SwaggerHub. So you can migrate from SmartBears cloud hosted to OnPrem or between OnPrem installations.
