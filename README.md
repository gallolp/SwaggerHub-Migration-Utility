# SwaggerHub-Installation-Migration-Utility

SwaggerHub-Installation-Migration-Utility is a migration utility for current SwaggerHub SAAS users to move their API Specs and domains from the SmartBear Hosted SwaggerHub to an On-Premise SwaggerHub. 

It may have extensibility for moving between two SAAS Orgs or two OnPrem installations but this isn't currently tested.
